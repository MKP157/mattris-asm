# What's this?

The source code in this folder contains older iterations 
of  _mattris_, at each stage of its reprogramming for x86 
assembly. They're more like scratch work than finished 
products, however I've kept them here because I think they're
interesting.

These versions formed the base game before major changes were made.
As per the class I did this project for, the first step to
our making hand-made assembly was to convert loop structures
into (unsafe) loops using "goto" statements and labels. From there,
we were meant to compile the code alongside handwritten assembly
source files. I also experimented with compiling inline assembly
code as well, which is why there is a "preinline" variation.
